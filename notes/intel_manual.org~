* Chapter 1
- The processor uses *byte addressing*. The memory is organized and accessed as a
  sequence of bytes.
  - Whether one or more bytes are being accessed, a byte address is used to
    locate the byte or bytes memory. 
  - The range of memory that can be addressed is called an *address space*.

- The processor also supports *segmented addressing*. This is a form of 
  addressing where a program may have many independent address spaces,
  called segments. 
  - For example, a program can keep its code (instructions) and stack in separate
    segments. Code addresses would always refer to the code space, and stack 
    addresses would always refer to the stack space. 
  - The following notation is used to specify a byte address within a segment:
    Segment-register:Byte-address (this is a "segment address")
    - Example: 
      DS:FF79H (address FF79H in the segment pointed by the DS register)
      CS:EIP (identifies an instruction address in the code segment. The CS
      register points to the code segment and the EIP register contains the
      address of the instruction.
