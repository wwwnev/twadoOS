* Pre-reading
http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/, chapter 1 and chapter 2
** TODO Review basic concepts of electricity: atoms, electrons, protons, neutrons, current flow
*** electron 
- smallest known carrier of electric charge. ~1.6 * 10⁻¹⁹ C (coulombs)
- coulomb = unit of electrical charge, force generated between point charges.
*** Electric charge  
(from wiki) physical property of matter that causes it to experience a
force when placed in an electromagnetic field. Electric charge can be positive 
or negative (commonly carried by protons and electrons respectively, by 
convention). Like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each 
other. An object with no net charge is referred to as electrically neutral.
*** Atom
All bjects are composed of atoms, akin to building-blocks.
**** Composition
Atoms are composed of smaller compoenents known as *particles*:
protons, neutrons and electrons.

** TODO Review Ohm's law
