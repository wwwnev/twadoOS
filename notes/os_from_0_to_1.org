* Pre-reading
http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/, chapter 1 and chapter 2
** DONE (Mostly) Basic concepts elec.: atoms, electrons, protons, neutrons, cur. flow
*** electron 
- smallest known carrier of electric charge. ~1.6 * 10⁻¹⁹ C (coulombs)
- coulomb = unit of electrical charge, force generated between point charges.
*** Electric charge  
(from wiki) physical property of matter that causes it to experience a
force when placed in an electromagnetic field. Electric charge can be positive 
or negative (commonly carried by protons and electrons respectively, by 
convention). Like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each 
other. An object with no net charge is referred to as electrically neutral.
*** Atom
All objects are composed of atoms, akin to building-blocks.
**** Composition
- Atoms are composed of smaller compoenents known as *particles*:
protons (have positive electrict charge), neutrons and electrons (negative ch.). 
(C-c C-x C-v, to display/hide img)
[[./an_atom.png]]

- Nucleus made of protons and neutrons.
- Amount of protons changes the type of atom, the elemental identity
- Not the case for neutrons, although as hard to add or remove.
- Mass would change slightly and atom may become radioactive for example.
- Electrons have more freedom to move around, can even leave the atom.
- Electrons and protons are attracted to one another over a distance.
- Electrons and protons are repulsed between themselves, except at very short
distances (see strong nuclear force).
- At equal presence in an atom, electrons and protons counteract each other
so that the net charge within the atom is zero 
- Opposed to being charged when nb. of electrons != protons. 
- Neutrons have no charge and are not attracted or repelled by particles.

*** Static Electricity
- It is the result of an imbalance in electrons between objects.
- Static because the displaced electrons tend to remain stationary after being
moved.
- For the most part a nuisance.

*** Conductors, Insulators, and Electron flow
**** Electric conductivity
Property of a material: relative mobility of electrons.
Determined by the types of atoms in a material, and how they are linked together
Free electrons: virt. unbond electrons, free to leave their respective atoms
Conductors: materials with high electron mobility
Insulators: materials with low electron mobility
**** Electron flow / Electric current
While the normal motion of “free” electrons in a conductor is random, with no 
particular direction or speed, electrons can be influenced to move in a 
coordinated fashion through a conductive material. (~dynamic electricity)
When electrons move uniformely through a conductor, they push the ones ahead of
them. If one stops, all of them stops. So if an electron enters one end of a
cable, another has to exit at the other end, pretty much instantaneously.
*** Electric circuits
For continuous charge flow, you need a continuous (looping) path, aka a circuit
*** Voltage and currents
- In the context of electrical power sources, *voltage* is the amount of pot. 
energy available (work to be done) per unit charge, to move charges through a 
conductor. Always referenced between 2 points, since it's potential energy.
- In simpler terms, it's the measure of "push" available to motivate the charge
- Chemical reactions (battery), radiant energy (solar cells), and the influence
of magnetism on conductors (generators) are a few ways to produce voltage.
Battery: (+) tries to push charge carriers (electrons), while (-) tries to
attract charge carriers. (a bit confusing) +/- of battery are polarities at ends
- Electrical current: continuous and uniform flow of charge through a circuit
- Direct current (DC): single direction flow of current
- Alternating current (AC): direction of current switches back and forth
- Voltage drop: kinda like voltage. If you break a circuit, there will be the
full voltage produced by the battery manifested across the break.
- Polarity of voltage drop: (across break ofc) depends on the order...
Between the positive end and the negative end, it is a positive polarity. But
between the negative end and the positive end, it is a negative polarity. So
we just say that the polarity is (+) when connected to the + polarity of the 
battery. It's so easy, it's hard to explain?
- Remember, polarity is *relative between 2 points*
*** Switches and resistances
- Switch open = open circuit = electric charge cant flow continuously
- Conductors have low resistance, insulators have high resistance.
- Resistance = opposing the flow of electric current
- There will be voltage manifested (or “dropped”) between any points in a 
circuit with resistance between them.
- although the amount of current (i.e., the quantity of charge moving past a 
given point every second) is uniform in a simple circuit, the amount of 
voltage (potential energy per unit charge) between different sets of points 
in a single circuit may vary considerably.

*** TODO Semi-conductors, diodes
** DONE Review Ohm's law
- Current : Continuous movement of electric charge through the conductors of a circuit is called a current
- Voltage : Force motivating charge carriers to "flow"/move
| Quantity   | Symbol | Unit of measurement | Unit Abbreviation |
| Current    | I      | Ampere              | A                 |
| Voltage    | E or V | Volt                | V                 |
| Resistance | R      | Ohm                 | Omega             |
*** Ohm's Law Equation
- E = I * R
*** An analogy
- Pressure = Flow rate * resistance
*** Power and work
- Power: measure of how much work can be performed in a given amount of time. 
Work is generally defined in terms of the lifting of a weight against the pull
of gravity. The heavier the weight and/or the higher it is lifted, the more work
has been done. Power is a measure of how rapidly a standard amount of work is 
done.
- Power: 
- P = I * E
- Unit is the watt, "W"
*** Joule's Law Equation
- P = I² * R
*** Resistors
PCB: an assembly made of sandwiched layers of insulating phenolic fiber-board 
and conductive copper strips, into which components may be inserted and secured
by a low-temperature welding process called “soldering.”
- Devices called resistors are built to provide precise amounts of resistance in
electric circuits. Resistors are rated both in terms of their resistance (ohms)
and their ability to dissipate heat energy (watts).
* 1. Domain documents
** 1.2.1 Software requirement document
Software requirement document includes both a list of requirements and
a description of the problem domain.
A good way to test the quality of a require-
ment document is to provide it to a domain expert for proofreading,
to ensure he can understand the material thoroughly.

** 1.2.2 Software Specification document
Software specification document states rules relating desired behavior of
the output devices to all possible behavior of the input devices, as well
as any rules that other parts of the problem domain must obey.
Only concerns interface design.

** 1.3 Documents for writing an x86 OS
- Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual (Volume 1, 2, 3)
- Intel® 3 Series Express Chipset Family Datasheet
- System V Application Binary Interface
Intel documents divide the requirement and specification sections clearly,
but call the sections with different names. The corresponding to the requirement
document is a section called “Functional Description”, which consists mostly of 
domain description; for specification, “Register Description” section describes 
all programming interfaces.

* 2. From hardware to software: Layers of abstraction
- Layers of abstraction are based.
- Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect-Transistor (MOSFET)
- CMOS = Complementary MOSFET, contains NMOS and PMOS which are complementary
- A k-input gate uses k PMOS and k NMOS transistors
- With the help of transistors, (etched on silicon?)
- We can create NAND gates with those transistors. Voltages entering the 2 gates 
  dictate whether the inputs are 1 or 0. Same idea for the output voltage.
- Arrangements of NAND gates give us access to all other gates.
  - NOT : Plug the same input voltage in both inputs of the NAND
    but i dont think this is the way it's done.
  - AND : NAND -> NOT
  - OR :  NOT x NAND NOT y
  - NOR : NOR -> NOT

- Arrangements of various gates
