** TODO Basic concepts elec.: atoms, electrons, protons, neutrons, cur. flow
*** electron 
- smallest known carrier of electric charge. ~1.6 * 10⁻¹⁹ C (coulombs)
- coulomb = unit of electrical charge, force generated between point charges.
*** Electric charge  
(from wiki) physical property of matter that causes it to experience a
force when placed in an electromagnetic field. Electric charge can be positive 
or negative (commonly carried by protons and electrons respectively, by 
convention). Like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each 
other. An object with no net charge is referred to as electrically neutral.
*** Atom
All objects are composed of atoms, akin to building-blocks.
**** Composition
- Atoms are composed of smaller compoenents known as *particles*:
protons (have positive electrict charge), neutrons and electrons (negative ch.).

- Nucleus made of protons and neutrons.
- Amount of protons changes the type of atom, the elemental identity
- Not the case for neutrons, although as hard to add or remove.
- Mass would change slightly and atom may become radioactive for example.
- Electrons have more freedom to move around, can even leave the atom.
- Electrons and protons are attracted to one another over a distance.
- Electrons and protons are repulsed between themselves, except at very short
distances (see strong nuclear force).
- At equal presence in an atom, electrons and protons counteract each other
so that the net charge within the atom is zero 
- Opposed to being charged when nb. of electrons != protons. 
- Neutrons have no charge and are not attracted or repelled by particles.

*** Static Electricity
- It is the result of an imbalance in electrons between objects.
- Static because the displaced electrons tend to remain stationary after being
moved.
- For the most part a nuisance.

*** Conductors, Insulators, and Electron flow


** TODO Review Ohm's law
